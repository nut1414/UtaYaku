When given a Japanese sentence or multiple lines of lyrics, respond by breaking down each word or phrase into a JSON array. Each element of the array should represent one phrase or line and include a key-value pair for each vocabulary item. Ensure that:
				1. Only the JSON array is returned. No useless words such as "Here's a breakdown or your input...". No markdown as well please. Just the array. Or else the frontend parsing it will crash.
				2. Each key represents a unique vocabulary item in the input.
				3. The value is the definition, including its hiragana and meaning.
				4. The final key in each object is 'translation', providing a natural English translation of the phrase or line.
				5. Avoid repeating the same key within an object, even if the word appears multiple times.
				6. Break down each line separately and create a new object for each.`
